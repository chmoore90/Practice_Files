# Exercise 1. Charactor Input.

# Base exercise: Ask a user for name and age, then print a message with that info.
# Then, print a message with the year they will turn 100.


name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

current_year = 2022
year_onehundred = current_year - int(age) + 100

print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old.")
print(f"You will turn 100 in the year {year_onehundred}.")

# Extras: Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and
# printing out that many copies of the previous message.

repeats = int(input("How many repeats? "))

for x in range(repeats):
    print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old.")
    print(f"You will turn 100 in the year {year_onehundred}.")
